# vcpy

vcpy is an easy-to-use Python library to issue verifiable credentials. 

There are many kinds of verifiable credentials like W3C's Verifiable Claims, Blockcerts, and others. The goal of `vcpy` is to allow you to easily issue these from your own application!

*Note: this is a WIP, currently only Blockcerts issuing with anchoring to the Ethereum network is provided.*

## Why 
Although useful as PoCs, current implementations of verifiable credentials-issuing software projects suffer one or more of the following issues: 
- race conditions
- imposibility to use as part of a larger application
- overengineered code that makes it hard to contribute to

`vcpy` tries to improve user adoption by providing a better user experience, and to encourage open source contributions by using simpler code and good documentation.
Because Clean Code is better than fancy code.
